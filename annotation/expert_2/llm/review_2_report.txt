Paper Title: Multi-Source Unsupervised Hyperparameter Optimization

Paper Abstract: How can we conduct efficient hyperparameter optimization for a completely new task? In this work, we consider a novel setting, where we search for the optimal hyperparameters for a target task of interest using only unlabeled target task and ‘somewhat relevant’ source task datasets. In this setting, it is essential to estimate the ground-truth target task objective using only the available information. We propose estimators to unbiasedly approximate the ground-truth with a desirable variance property. Building on these estimators, we provide a general and tractable hyperparameter optimization procedure for our setting. The experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed framework broadens the applications of automated hyperparameter optimization.

Target Review (Reviewer 2):
I'd like to thank the authors for the clarifications. I hope the authors will discuss and compare to more baselines and I look forward to the paper revision.

Tone and Sentiment Analysis:
Sentiment: Positive
Sentiment Reason: I'd like to thank the authors for the clarifications
Tone: Supportive
Tone Reason: Words like 'thank', 'I look forward to' show a supportive tone

Internal Consistency Check:
Consistent_in_itself: True
Consistency_reason: The reviewer expresses gratitude for the authors' clarifications and then provides a constructive suggestion for further improvement, maintaining a consistent tone of appreciation and critique.

Inter-Review Comparison:
is_consistent_with_others: False
alignment_score: 2
contradictory_points: The target review requests more baselines and seems to be waiting for a revision, while other reviews have already defended the acceptance of the paper and appreciated its significance, clarity, and rigorous evaluation.
possible_bias_flags: The target review appears to be more critical and less appreciative of the paper's contributions compared to other reviews.
summary_of_differences: The target review is more critical and focused on future improvements, whereas other reviews are more positive and appreciative of the paper's strengths. The tone and sentiment of the target review diverge from the other reviews.

Bias Detection:
bias_detected: True
bias_types: ['Confirmation Bias']
confidence_score: 8
evidence: The target review is more critical and focused on future improvements, requesting more baselines and a revision, whereas other reviews are more positive and appreciative of the paper's strengths. This divergence in tone and sentiment suggests that the target reviewer may be holding the paper to a different standard or have preconceived notions about what the paper should achieve.
suggestion_for_improvements: The reviewer should consider acknowledging the paper's contributions and strengths, as appreciated by other reviewers, and provide more specific and constructive feedback on the requested baselines and revisions. This would help to ensure a more balanced evaluation.
